# Description of the Repository 

The **Dataset** folder consists of the dataset obtained in the VARIAN format, which consists of a set of folders (fid, log, procpar.txt, and text.txt), where each folder represents one sample.  
To facilitate the analysis of the obtained NMR data, it was divided into sub-datasets described as “exometabolome,” “endometabolome,” and “extracts,” where the latter specifically refers to the EGCPC and ETCPC extracts.

The  **Methods.R** folder contains the adapted functions of the *specmine* package and newly implemented methods.

To acess to the **R notebook** with the code implemented and all the results and discussion access to link https://mendes2022.github.io/Projecto/ .
